A few weeks ago = 6 hours (mostly research and learning Leap SDK, starting code)
11/15 = 7 hrs (primarily learning Tesseract and modifying Pytesser, starting recognition)
11/16 = 6 hrs (mainly building on code and training Tesseract [this is not reflected in the code, however the tessdata files can be found; mostly box and tif creation and
console input])
11/18 = 6 hrs (finishing Tesseract training, modifying Pytesser to take modes [created corresponding whitelists in tessdata], getting most gestures done)
11/19 = 1 hr (finishing up first chunk of code, all gestures finished)
11/25 = 4 hrs (basically revamping code, learning openCV)
11/26 = 6 hrs (writing backend for program, got openCV camera to work, distance formula, all dictionary operations and json storage, training, etc.)
11/27 = 4 hrs (started working on GUI, finalized openCV setup)
11/28 = 10 hrs (equations for menu screen depth, relative luminance, HSV conversions etc; mainly did GUI stuff!)
12/1 = 8 hours (did camera screen and result screen, opened images in canvas, font color based on background, background color varies depending on item, etc.)
12/2 = 10 hours (did add [with heavy file IO stuff] and browse, as well as tutorial, polished out swipes, etc.)
12/3 = 8 hours (finalized everything, edited docs, made video)

total = 76 hrs
